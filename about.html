        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm <strong>Fathia Diekola Gbolahan</strong> a Nigerian Computer
          Science student and freelance frontend developer. I love turning ideas
          into interactive, user-friendly websites that are both beautiful and
          functional. My passion lies in solving real-world problems with clean
          design and purposeful code. Every project I build helps me grow a
          little more confident in my journey as a developer.

        <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
        <p>
          Hey future Fathia, you did it! You completed the HNG internship your
          first ever internship. You've learned new frameworks, grown stronger
          in React, and built the confidence you once prayed for. It took a lot
          of effort, but you kept going. Keep learning, keep growing, and never
          stop building what you love.

        <h2>Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Every day is an opportunity to learn something new even the smallest
          progress matters. The more you explore, the more you realize that tech
          isn't just about coding; it's about creating meaningful experiences
          that help others. Keep that mindset alive.
